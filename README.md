## Photo Site

The photo site is a mockup of a portfolio for a photographer.  I built this website using React and used Axios to pull from the Unsplash API.

The reason I built this website was to put more practice into what I have been learning with React.  I have been looking for more ways to implement what I have been learning during tutorials.  If you want to know more about any of the images that are displayed, all you need to do is click on the image, and it will take you to the Unsplash site.
